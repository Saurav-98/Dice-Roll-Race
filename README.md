# Dice Roll Race

Dice Roll Race is a fun 2 Player Dice Game created using HTML, CSS and JS.
It Starts from Player 1 turn, where he can roll the dice as many times the player wants,
the current score ( The sum of dice score for single turn gets added and stored),
whenever the player wants he can click the hold button and save the current score earned in the final score and the turn switches to the second player.
Meanwhile if the player 1 gets a 1 ( Dice score ) all his current score gets cancelled and Turn switches to the second player.

The Goal is to reach 100 scores as soon as possible.

Once the Final score reaches 100 Player can hold the vallue and the Game will end having one winner.

Player then can restart the game by clicking oon the New game button.

## Roadmap

I have followed this Flowchart to create the basic functionality of the App
![Flow Chart of the Game Logic]("./pig-game-flowchart.png")

And then added few features to make the Game more accessible Such as
1- Showing Which player's turn it is
2- Changing the Button and Dice Score Color When Player gets 1
3- Switchng the active Window to the next Player
4- Adding and removing the Winner and Loser class to make the Winner Obvious
5- Added a small timeOut of 1s to switch the player.

I have tried to make the Code Modular and functional and used appropriate comments from the start but it got over Crowded while adding the later features.
However the Game is completely functional at the moment and I will be working on it to make the code more performant, readable and scalable.

Any Suggetions and advice on the Project is welcome :)
